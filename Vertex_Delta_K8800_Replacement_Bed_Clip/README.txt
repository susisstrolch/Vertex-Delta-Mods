# Summary

This is a replacement bed clip for the Velleman Vertex Delta K8800 printer.

It's based off of the original ones that come with the printer, but with a slant on top that fixes the bed better and prevents it from getting knocked about by the nozzle, thus improving quality on longer and more complex prints. The slant is there so the bed still has unrestricted downward movement, so piezo sensor leveling still works.

The original bed mounting system is heavily flawed in that the bed has significant play in X-Y plane, and can be knocked about if the nozzle drags across the infill, for example, or knocks into something. Even with everything tuned in, you still get noticable layer shifts because of this, just from the drag of the nozzle across the current layer. This should fix the issue.

You only need to print ONE of these and replace ONE - it will keep the bed in place, while allowing you to remove the bed as before when necessary. You just need to grab and lift it from the other side (where the original clips are).
